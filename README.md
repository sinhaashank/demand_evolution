# Following power demand in major EU Economies

You can use this repo to follow the evolution of power demand in EU. The data has been extracted from [ENTSO-E transparency](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/)

ENTSO-E, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, is the association for the cooperation of the European transmission system operators (TSOs). The 39 member TSOs representing 35 countries are responsible for the secure and coordinated operation of Europeâ€™s electricity system, the largest interconnected electrical grid in the world.

ENTSO-E data is stored on a local database using [Arctic](https://pypi.org/project/arctic/) - [Link](https://github.com/sinhaashank/entsoe_sftp_data) to the repo

Here is a sample plot -
